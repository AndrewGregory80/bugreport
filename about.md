We're a bunch of geeks who worked together on magazines including the crowdfunded Linux Voice.

* Andrew Gregory is the guitar-playing, smooth talking features ediitor of HackSpace magazine
* Ben Everard manages to geek out about just about anything from mushrooms to microcontrollers. He's the editor of HackSpace magazine
* Graham Morrison fiddles with synthesizers and old computers. He's attempting to make Canonical's documentation match its software.
* Mike Saunders is a Cumbrian living in exile in Munich. He works for Libre Office and teaches an approximation of English to the people of Germany.
